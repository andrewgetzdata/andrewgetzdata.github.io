A complete redesign and rebuild of my personal portfolio website, moving from Jekyll to Astro while implementing Vercel's Geist design principles for a clean, modern, and performant experience.

## Project Overview

This project involved completely reimagining my online presence with a focus on simplicity, performance, and purposeful design. The goal was to create a site that better reflects my current work and aesthetic preferences while providing an excellent foundation for future content.

## Design Philosophy

The new design follows Geist design principles:

- **Simplicity** - Remove unnecessary elements and focus on content
- **Minimalism** - Clean layouts with generous whitespace
- **Speed** - Optimized performance with static generation
- **Precision** - Consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
- **Clarity** - Clear navigation and content organization

## Technical Implementation

### Framework Choice: Astro

I chose Astro for several key reasons:

- **Performance**: Static site generation with minimal JavaScript
- **Content Management**: Built-in content collections for blog posts and projects
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support and intuitive component architecture
- **Flexibility**: Can integrate any frontend framework when needed
- **SEO**: Excellent SEO capabilities out of the box

### Design System

The design system is built around:

- **Typography**: Official Geist Sans and Geist Mono fonts with CDN fallbacks
- **Color System**: High-contrast black background theme with light mode toggle
- **Spacing**: Systematic spacing scale following design tokens
- **Components**: Reusable components following Swiss design principles

### Key Features

1. **Responsive Navigation** with mobile-friendly hamburger menu
2. **Theme Toggle** supporting both dark and light modes with LocalStorage persistence
3. **Content Collections** for blog posts and project showcases
4. **Contact Form** with validation and success states
5. **Print-Friendly Resume** page with optimized print styles
6. **Accessible Design** with skip links, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation

## Development Process

The project was executed in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Clean slate - Remove Jekyll files and initialize Astro
2. **Phase 2**: Implement Geist design system foundation
3. **Phase 3**: Create core page structure and navigation
4. **Phase 4**: Setup content management system
5. **Phase 5**: Add enhanced features and integrations
6. **Phase 6**: Documentation and deployment optimization

## Results

The new site delivers significant improvements:

- **Performance**: Lighthouse scores of 95+ across all metrics
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with semantic HTML and proper ARIA usage
- **Mobile Experience**: Responsive design that works beautifully across all devices
- **Content Management**: Easy-to-use markdown workflow for blog posts and projects
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-structured codebase with TypeScript for reliability

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced several important principles:

1. **Start with content** - Design should serve the content, not overshadow it
2. **Performance matters** - Fast sites provide better user experiences
3. **Simplicity scales** - Simple designs are easier to maintain and extend
4. **Accessibility is essential** - Building for everyone makes sites better for everyone
5. **Tools should enhance** - Choose tools that improve the development experience without adding unnecessary complexity

## Future Enhancements

Plans for continued improvement:

- **Content Growth**: Regularly publish blog posts and project case studies
- **Search Functionality**: Add search capabilities for blog content
- **Analytics Integration**: Implement privacy-focused analytics
- **Performance Monitoring**: Set up automated performance monitoring
- **Content Optimization**: Optimize images and implement progressive loading

This project represents not just a website redesign, but a commitment to quality, performance, and user experience that will guide future development work.
