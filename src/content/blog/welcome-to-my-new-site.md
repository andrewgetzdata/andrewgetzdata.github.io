I'm excited to introduce my completely redesigned portfolio and personal website. After using Jekyll for several years, I decided it was time for a fresh start with modern tools and a design that better reflects my current work and aesthetic preferences.

## Why the Redesign?

The previous site served me well, but I wanted something that felt more aligned with my current focus on clean, purposeful design and modern development practices. The new site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and follows [Vercel's Geist design principles](https://vercel.com/geist/introduction), emphasizing simplicity, minimalism, and excellent performance.

### Key Improvements

- **Performance**: Static site generation with minimal JavaScript
- **Design**: Clean, black background aesthetic with high contrast typography
- **Typography**: Official Geist Sans and Geist Mono fonts for optimal readability
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works beautifully on all devices

## Technology Choices

I chose Astro for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Astro's "islands architecture" means JavaScript only loads when needed
2. **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support and intuitive component model
3. **Flexibility**: Works with any frontend framework, though I'm keeping it simple with vanilla components
4. **Content Management**: Built-in content collections make managing blog posts and projects straightforward

The design system is inspired by Swiss design principles—generous whitespace, clear typography hierarchy, and purposeful use of color. Everything serves a function, and unnecessary elements have been removed.

## What's Next?

I'll be using this space to share thoughts on:

- **Development insights** from building modern web applications
- **Data stories** that emerge from interesting datasets
- **Process reflections** on workflow and productivity
- **Learning updates** as I explore new technologies

The site will grow organically with content that I hope provides value to fellow developers, data practitioners, and anyone interested in the intersection of technology and storytelling.

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to [get in touch](/contact) if you'd like to connect or discuss any of the topics I cover here.
